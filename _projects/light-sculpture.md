## Kinetic Sculpture Project

**Introduction**
The kinetic sculpture is a capstone project that integrates engineering, programming, art, and manufacturing. It uses two revolving discs to create patterns of motion, an effect known as the Moire effect.

**CAD + Design**
*   **Modeling:** The sculpture was designed using Solidworks, a parametric modeling software. The process involved building the sculpture from individual components to a complete assembly.
*   **Moire Discs:** The design of the discs was inspired by the work of David C. Roy. The final design uses two sets of opposite-facing interlocking spokes to create a sense of movement toward the center. The design was sketched in Autodesk Sketchbook and then modeled in Solidworks before being machined on a CNC.

**Manufacturing**
The fabrication of the sculpture's components was divided into two main processes:
*   **Lathe:** Spacers, axles, and bearing covers were fabricated on a lathe.
*   **Mill:** The spacer base mount and vertical base mount were created on a mill.

**Controls and Assembly**
*   **Electronics:** The project involved extensive soldering to connect components, including a custom PCB. The sculpture is controlled by an Arduino.
*   **Assembly:** The sculpture was assembled in sub-assemblies to streamline the process. An arbor press was used to push axles into bearings.
*   **Programming:** The programming was done in C++ using the Arduino IDE. The sculpture has three switches, allowing for up to eight different programmatic patterns. A key feature is a reversal function that uses a tachometer and an ultrasonic sensor to return the disc to its original position.

**Skills Learned**
*   Manufacturing techniques on both the lathe and mill.
*   CAD in Solidworks, particularly in assemblies.
*   Basic circuitry.
*   Visual design and associated elements.
*   Practical engineering experience in larger-scale projects.
*   Effective technical writing.
