Hi! I'm Alok, an undergrad at UC Berkeley excited about CS, math, and everything in between. Formerly, I've done a research internship through the [NSF REU porgram](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/reu) applying [ML + computational linguistics to animal communication](https://uta-acl2.github.io/), did two software engineering internships at a [power electronics company](https://www.enerpro-inc.com/), and researched [novel planetary defense methods](https://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/projects/pi-terminal-planetary-defense).

 Currently, I'm involved in robot learning research at Berkeley under Prof. Jitendra Malik's lab. I'm also on course staff for Berkeley's intro [lin-alg + singals course](https://eecs16a.org). In my free time, I like hiking, making room decor and projects at hackathons, playing chess, and optimizing my Chipotle order.
