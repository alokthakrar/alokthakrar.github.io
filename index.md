Hi! I'm Alok, an undergrad at UC Berkeley excited about CS, math, and everything in between. Formerly, I've researched [novel planetary defense methods](https://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/projects/pi-terminal-planetary-defense), worked in [power electronics computer-engineering](https://www.enerpro-inc.com/), and developed tutoring content for Berkeley's [lin-alg course](https://csmentors.studentorg.berkeley.edu/#/team){:target="_blank"}.

I'm currently a [CS research intern at UTA](https://uta-acl2.github.io/index.html), using ML and computational linguistics tools to investigate animal language & communication. I'm also involved in computational genomics research at UCSF. Broadly, I'm excited about education, implications of computing, and chess.
